* Launchd: Automated tasks
All automated tasks are stored here, as defined in launchd format

All services can be installed and enabled via the install script

* Need to grant "full disk access" to the daily_cleanup scrip
- Open system settings
- Privacy and secirity
- Click "+"
- cmd-shift-G to search /bin/bash

* UPDATE <2024-01-25 Thu>
- It looks like you just need to give `/bin/bash` full disk access
  - Probably because the script has /bin/bash at the top
- the `daily_cleanup.sh` doesn't appear to need full disk access

* Debugging
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.grado.daily_cleanup
