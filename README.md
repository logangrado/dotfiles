# Grado's Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles.

These days, just about everything is DOOM Emacs.

Use `link.sh` to link all dotfiles and configs into the appropriate places.

`install.sh` needs some work - it used to install everything, but became unweildy. I am currently investigating moving over to installing everything with nix-pkgs...
